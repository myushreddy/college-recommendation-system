## 💻 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myushreddy/college-recommendation-system.git
cd college-recommendation-system
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
```

3. **Access merged master data**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load master datasets (recommended)
colleges = pd.read_csv('data/master_colleges.csv')
courses = pd.read_csv('data/master_courses.csv')

# Example: Find Top 10 NIRF ranked colleges
top_10 = colleges[colleges['NIRF_Rank'].notna()].nsmallest(10, 'NIRF_Rank')
print(top_10[['College Name', 'City', 'State', 'NIRF_Rank', 'Average Fees']])

# Example: Find Computer Science courses
cs_courses = courses[courses['Course'].str.contains('Computer Science', case=False)]
print(f"Found {len(cs_courses)} Computer Science programs")
```

### Re-run Data Processing (if needed)
