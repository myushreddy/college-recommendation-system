## 💡 Understanding What Each Script Does

### **`data_cleaning.py`** (Main Script)
```python
# What it does:
1. Reads all 3 CSV files
2. Standardizes college names
3. Handles missing values
4. Cleans course names
5. Normalizes fees
6. Saves cleaned versions
```

### **`verify_cleaning.py`** (Verification)
```python
# What it does:
1. Loads original and cleaned files
2. Shows before/after comparisons
3. Displays statistics
4. Confirms cleaning was successful
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### **1. Data Cleaning = Making Data Consistent**
Think of it like organizing your closet:
- All shirts together (standardization)
- No missing hangers (handling missing values)
- Everything folded the same way (normalization)

### **2. Standardization = Same Format**
```
Before: "IIT madras", "IIT MADRAS", "IIT Madras"
After:  "IIT Madras", "IIT Madras", "IIT Madras"
         ↑ All the same now!
```

### **3. Handling Missing Values = No Empty Spots**
```
Before: Name: "ABC College", City: [EMPTY]
After:  Name: "ABC College", City: "Not Available"
```

### **4. Normalization = Standard Units**
```
Before: "₹3,50,600", "350600.0", "3.5 Lakhs"
After:  350600.00,   350600.00,   350000.00
        ↑ All as plain numbers!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **What You Can Do Now:**

1. **View the cleaned files:**
   ```bash
   # Open in VS Code
   code data/cleaned_engineering_colleges_india.csv
   ```

2. **Check the data:**
   - Look for college names you recognize
   - Verify the fees look correct
   - Check that courses are properly formatted

3. **Ready for merging:**
   - Now we can combine all 3 datasets
   - Create a unified database
   - Build search functionality
