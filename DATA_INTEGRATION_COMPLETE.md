## 💻 How to Use Merged Data

### **Load Master Databases:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load master datasets
colleges = pd.read_csv('data/master_colleges.csv')
courses = pd.read_csv('data/master_courses.csv')

print(f"Total colleges: {len(colleges)}")
print(f"Total course entries: {len(courses)}")
```

### **Example Queries:**

**1. Find Top NIRF Ranked Colleges:**
```python
top_colleges = colleges[colleges['NIRF_Rank'].notna()].nsmallest(10, 'NIRF_Rank')
print(top_colleges[['College Name', 'City', 'State', 'NIRF_Rank']])
```

**2. Search by State:**
```python
tamil_nadu_colleges = colleges[colleges['State'] == 'Tamil Nadu']
print(f"Colleges in Tamil Nadu: {len(tamil_nadu_colleges)}")
```

**3. Find Affordable Colleges:**
```python
affordable = colleges[
    (colleges['Average Fees'] > 0) & 
    (colleges['Average Fees'] < 200000)
]
print(f"Colleges under ₹2 lakhs: {len(affordable)}")
```

**4. Course-Specific Search:**
```python
cs_courses = courses[courses['Course'].str.contains('Computer Science', case=False)]
print(f"Colleges offering Computer Science: {len(cs_courses)}")
```

**5. Find Accredited Colleges:**
```python
nba_accredited = colleges[colleges['NBA_Accreditation'] != 'Not Available']
print(f"NBA accredited colleges: {len(nba_accredited)}")
```
