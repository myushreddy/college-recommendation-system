# 🎓 Data Cleaning - Visual Guide

## What Happened in Simple Terms

### **Before Cleaning** 😕
```
Your data was messy:
├── College names had extra spaces
├── Missing values everywhere  
├── Courses with line breaks
└── Fees in different formats
```

### **After Cleaning** ✨
```
Your data is now clean:
├── College names standardized
├── No missing values
├── Courses properly formatted
└── Fees as pure numbers
```

"IIT  Delhi"                                    ← Double space

✅ AFTER:
"National Institute of Technology Rourkela"
"Visvesvaraya National Institute"
"IIT Delhi"
```

### **Example 2: Course Names**

```
❌ BEFORE:
"COMPUTER SCIENCE &
 ENGINEERING"                                    ← Line break in middle!

"CSE"                                           ← Just abbreviation

✅ AFTER:
"Computer Science and Engineering"              ← Clean, full name
"Computer Science and Engineering"              ← Expanded
```

### **Example 3: Missing Values**

```
❌ BEFORE:
| College Name | City     | State  | Rating |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
